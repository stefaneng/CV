        \item Physiological and lifestyle state time-series analyses for exercise oncology projects collaboration with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC)
        \item Developed joint genotyping GATK pipeline and performed joint genotyping on UCLA COVID dataset of over 700 patients which became part of the Host Genetics Initiative COVID-19 study \cite{Covid2022}.
        \item First author on prospective study on active surveillance patients to predict upgrading on prostate biopsy \cite{EngLiss2022}. Collaboration with University of Texas Health San Antonio.
        \item Assisted with crosstalk PCA adjustment method for over-representation analysis to find enriched pathways \cite{Livingstone2021}.
        \item Part of the computer science and statistics interview team and developed new coding questions and statistical questions. Performed 40+ computer science and statistics interviews.

\section{Unpublished Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{A Digital, Decentralized Clinical Trial of Exercise Therapy}. We created and evaluated the Digital Platform for Exercise (DPEx), a method enabling all study procedures to be conducted remotely in patientâ€™s homes with parallel high-resolution profiling of physiological response to exercise therapy. I analyzed the physiological time-series data collected from the smartwatches. Code is available here: \href{https://github.com/uclahs-cds/public-R-DigitalExercisePlatform}{github.com/uclahs-cds/public-R-DigitalExercisePlatform}
    \item \textit{Proportional Hazards Assumption Violations in Survival Analysis of Tumour mRNA Abundance Data}. Mentored high school student Dean Kim (Harvard 2026) on project investigating frequency of genes in which in which the proportional hazards assumption was violated in a Cox proportional hazard model. Meta-analysis was conducted across seventeen breast cancer and four non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cohorts.
    \item \textit{Exercise relation to clonal hematopoiesis (CH) in the MSK-IMPACT cohort}. Mentored two undergraduate students on an exploratory analysis of the relationship between exercise at time of cancer diagnosis and clonal hematopoiesis.
    \item \textit{HistogramZoo: A Generalized Framework for Segmentation and Characterization of 1-D Histograms}. We developed a computational framework for the segmentation, denoising and statistical characterization of discrete data and provide examples of its application to NGS data. The original application was designed for m6a methylation data for soon to be submitted work: \textit{The Landscape of N6 - Methyladenosine in Localised Primary Prostate Cancer}. Code is available here: \href{https://github.com/uclahs-cds/public-R-HistogramZoo}{github.com/uclahs-cds/public-R-HistogramZoo}
