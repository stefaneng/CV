abstract={Replicative immortality is a hallmark of cancer, and can be achieved through telomere lengthening and maintenance. Although the role of telomere length in cancer has been well studied, its association to genomic features is less well known. Here, we report the telomere lengths of 392 localized prostate cancer tumours and characterize their relationship to genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic features. Shorter tumour telomere lengths are associated with elevated genomic instability, including single-nucleotide variants, indels and structural variants. Genes involved in cell proliferation and signaling are correlated with tumour telomere length at all levels of the central dogma. Telomere length is also associated with multiple clinical features of a tumour. Longer telomere lengths in non-tumour samples are associated with a lower rate of biochemical relapse. In summary, we describe the multi-level integration of telomere length, genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics in localized prostate cancer.},

    abstract = {Host genetics is a key determinant of COVID-19 outcomes. Previously, the COVID-19
Host Genetics Initiative genome-wide association study used common variants to
identify multiple loci associated with COVID-19 outcomes. However, variants with the
largest impact on COVID-19 outcomes are expected to be rare in the population.
Hence, studying rare variants may provide additional insights into disease susceptibility
and pathogenesis, thereby informing therapeutics development. Here, we combined
whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing from 21 cohorts across 12 countries and
performed rare variant exome-wide burden analyses for COVID-19 outcomes. In an
analysis of 5,085 severe disease cases and 571,737 controls, we observed that
carrying a rare deleterious variant in the SARS-CoV-2 sensor toll-like receptor TLR7
(on chromosome X) was associated with a 5.3-fold increase in severe disease . This association was consistent across sexes. These
results further support TLR7 as a genetic determinant of severe disease and suggest
that larger studies on rare variants influencing COVID-19 outcomes could provide
additional insights.}

abstract={Protocol-based active surveillance (AS) biopsies have led to poor compliance. To move to risk-based protocols, more accurate imaging biomarkers are needed to predict upgrading on AS prostate biopsy. We compared restriction spectrum imaging (RSI-MRI) generated signal maps as a biomarker to other available non-invasive biomarkers to predict upgrading or reclassification on an AS biopsy.},
